#The Title is a Lie :P

This is obviously where I've hidden the secret birthday surprise website I have been making for Sreya's birthday 2015.


##Important Files :
 - index.html       -   The Page loaded by default by Apache when the Domain Name or IP Address is Accessed.
 - global.js        -   Used to set the Timer for the Countdown on the index.html page
 - second_timer.js  -   Since for some reason I could not get the global.js Timer to execute commands onEnd, I made another Javascript code to run the code that changes the page on timer expiry. It changes the header's texts when the Timer expires. It also removes the Countdown Animation and displays the Video.
 - 404.html         -   I thought why not make a Troll 404 Page since 2 out of the 4 Social Media Options didn't work but looked nice on the screen :P

###Notes :
The Index Page's HTML Elements are changed via Javascript after the countdown expires instead of openning a new window. This allows for a smoother feel.
